# TorrentPeek

By putting an SQLite database file (.db) inside a torrent, we can query its content -- by prioritizing pieces based on the SQL query -- and quickly *peek* at the content of the database without downloading it entirely.

TorrentPeek was inspired by [sqltorrent](https://github.com/bittorrent/sqltorrent).
